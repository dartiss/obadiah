# Obadiah

🌍Child theme for Susty, experimenting in creating more complete but sustainable sites.

For anybody who has had the pleasure of seeing Jack Lenox's talk about creating sustainable website, you'll know he's created a WordPress theme to demonstrate everything that he speaks about - Susty, a fully-fledged theme with as small a footprint as possible. However, even Jack recognises that Susty is maybe a bit too extreme in terms of just how stripped-back it is for use IRL.

Whilst Susty is specifically about a sustainable theme, I wondered how much further this could be taken. For example, can we reduce the footprint from WordPress or maybe how we guide a user through the site to reduce page loads. On top of that, I wanted to build upon Susty to create something still compact but, hopefully, more usable to the average site owner.

Step forward Obadiah - a child theme to Susty that adds extra features to make it more usable, whilst stripping back guff from core, Jetpack and others.

Read the Wiki to see how and why. And also, please, don't implement Obadiah without looking at the `functions.php` file - the ideas is that you'll want to configure this for your use (eventually I'll add in an admin screen so that you can do this without changing code).

So, download, install and let me know.
