# Obadiah

🌍Child theme for Susty, experimenting in creating more complete but sustainable sites.

For anybody who has had the pleasure of seeing Jack Lenox's talk about creating sustainable website, you'll know he's created a WordPress theme to demonstrate everything that he speaks about - Susty, a fully-fledged theme with as small a footprint as possible. However, even Jack recognises that Susty is maybe a bit too extreme in terms of just how stripped-back it is for use IRL. I wanted to build upon Susty to create something still compact but, hopefully, more usable to the average site owner.

Step forward Obadiah - a child theme to Susty that adds extra features to make it more usable, whilst trying to keep its sustainability credentials as best as possible.

So, download, install and let me know.
